## üìù What are we building?

Welcome fellow builder! My name is Matt and I'm going to be your sticker dealer!

You are going to join a special group of credit card anarchists who are building the future of digital payments.

Or to put it simply, you will be learning how to build an IRL payment processor with Solana Pay that issues Coupons and Receipts in the form of Compressed NFT's.

Right about now you're probably asking, "What makes this different than Square, PayPal, or one of the major IRL players like Visa and Mastercard?"

The answer:
* transaction fees are .00001 SOL, a fraction of 1 cent
* privacy, quit sharing your customer data with the greedy corporations
* instant fund settlement, quit waiting for your cash to be released


So lets dive in...

üõ† **The project**
So what will we be building here :)? Here's a little video:

If you have no experience w/ React **or** Next - checkout [this intro tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/nextjs-tutorial/) before you get started with this or maybe check out the intro docs [here](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs). 

You will also need the [Solana Tool Suite](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) so you can create your own compressed NFT collections from the terminal. Trust me, it's pretty sweet! :)
